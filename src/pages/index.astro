        <p class="leading-loose mb-12">
          MUV was founded by Dr. Kyle Womack to bridge the gap between the
          healthcare system and the gym. We focus on helping CrossFit, fitness,
          weightlifting, runners, and surfers continue their training without
          pain or need for unnecessary medications or surgeries. We help to
          improve any movement related issue you may be having so you can get
          you back to your activities fast, and come back better than before! We
          work in a hybrid approach that allows us to be able to help our
          athletes both in-person, as well as remotely.
